**Unification of Brand**

A team's icon is the way they can stay memorable in their competitior's eyes in addition to the judge's for the Imagery Award.  However, it's not just awards that are important.  How you, your team, and your workspace / pit look can vastly effect how another team views you.

The most basic thing to begin with is a style guide, for all matters official.  Any letters to go out, standardize the font and color and appeal.  For team uniform, standardize on shirts (whether they be t-shirts or polos), and pants / dresses.  However, you should never let design interrupt safety.

Some things to include in your style guide may include:

* Team's Colors
* Team's Logo (ALL versions)
    * Sponsor's Logo Guidelines (if they have any)
* Pit Design
* Pit Layout
* Banners
* Signs

Regardless of how you or your team decie to go in terms of vision, the most important thing you can do is have consistency.  A good document on the subject is by 1538, The Holy Cows.  [Read Here](http://www.team1538.com/downloads/2015BrandStandards.pdf)

**Document Style Guides**

Though traditionally, documents are typically the work of a business or business-like subteam, the way they appear can be a crucial role in how your sponsors view you.  Standardize on a team font, one that's *readable*, that you'll use for all of your letters leaving.  Another thing to consider would be team letterhead and footing.  Many businesses have official stationary for official business, and having such can only improve your reputation as an organization.
