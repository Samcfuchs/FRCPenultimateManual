## Business

**Starting Off**

The most important thing your team can do for business is to keep accurate notes to begin with.  Knowing how much you have, where it's going, and who is helping your team financially or otherwise is *very* important.  However, to keep looking as your expenses increase is not only the way businesses work, but also standard practice amongst the larger FRC teams.

**Notekeeping Philosophies**

First and foremost, paper isn't a bad way to keep track of things to begin with.  Though digital has it's advantages, companies you may reach out to often have digital letters and emails fall on dear ears.  Being aware of this going in can help you incredibly.

Notes can be kept on network shares, Google Drive, Dropbox, anything really.  As long as your business team can see all of your documents to make informed decisions, it works.

Having a hierarchy of business folk can also be helpful.  For example, having one student write a sponsor note / application and another proofread and approve it can very frequently find mistakes the first student had become blind to.  Rinse and repeat the process as needed, as more and more smaller, but important mistakes can crop up.

Keeping track of your sponsors and keeping in contact is incredibly important.  Some teams just use Excel / Google Sheets to keep track, and that should work for the majority of teams. However, tracking things like *individual contact info* , your previous years being sponsored by them, and anything and everything about the company's history in one place can help.

**Budgeting**

Knowing the amount of money your team will need for a season allows you as an organization to set goals as to how much they'll need, and in what rate.  For example, a Veteran Mid-Atlantic Robotics team will spend $5,000 on district registration for two events, and $4,000 on District Championship.  Knowing this in advance allows your team to have fundraisers, bake sakes, demos, and other financially beneficial events knowing well how much more you need.

**Fundrasiers**

Should your team have the advantage of a surplus of students willing to help the team, but are unable to financially, fundraisers may be a way to bring in some money to help offset costs.  Some ideas for fundraisers include:

* Gaming Tournaments
    * Smash
    * Quake
    * Halo
* Pasta Dinners / Socials
* Ice Cream Socials
* Car Washes
* Robot Demos with Tip Jars

As for recurring events, simply selling food after school / in town might be the way to go.  Though it'd be low income, it'd usually be reliable and repetitive income.

However, be aware that all of these come with various coordination efforts that would be needed, and were you to host said events at a school district, you would also need to follow their policies.  Proceed with caution on fundraisers.

**Getting Sponsors**

As described in Notekeeping Philosophies, getting in contact with sponsors can be a difficult thing to do.  eMails and phone calls often fall on deaf ears and empty inboxes.  For smaller companies, simply walking in the door and asking to show them / give them a synopsis of what your team does, and how they might be the right group or organization to help yours can make a world of difference.  For larger companies, however, having a foot in the door can help incredibly.  For this reason, finding companies that your student's families work for can get an application submitted where their site may say 'We're Not Accepting".
     * Eg: A student comes in and says that their aunt works for Robot Co Building Company, the largest supplier of parts in your state.  You reach out to her through the student, and have your proposal put before their corporate philanthropy department.  They say they'll help you, and even match the family member's donations.

Local businesses may be more willing to help you, especially if relevant or helpful.  For example, if a local Makerspace already spreads STEM and needs to promote youth involvement, FRC is an almost perfect fit for them.  In addition, food outlets may help your team out for fundraisers as part of charitable work.  HOWEVER, be aware that they still have to make money and may not be able to give you food or materials for free, but rather at their cost of raw materials.

**Keeping Sponsors**

The most important thing you can do to keep sponsors is to inform them of what you do.  Some ways to do this might be:
* Invite them to events.
* Send out a bi-weekly email blast with your stats and scores.
* Follow them on social media with team accounts and send stuff to them detailing your adventures as an FRC team.

The more effectively you keep yourselves in that organization's mind as a forward-thinking and good cause of their funds, you can potentially keep a sponsorship for years.  You may even be able to continue a "foot in the door" sponsorship that was started via a family member of a student, long after they have graduated.

Another very important factor in keeping sponsors is fufilling your contractual obligations.  Often when teams recieve sponsors, they promise the company x benefits.  A robot demonstration, them on the team website & shirt, etc.  Making sure your team fufills these requirements keeps your team in a good light, and also makes them more likely to keep the team as one of the organizations they support.

Finally, treating your sponsors properly, as organizations that support you, and not as "banks with hands" is an incredibly important but often overlooked thing.  They chose to support your team, and didn't *have* to.  In addition, sponsors may be supporting you with materials in kind instead of money, or with skilled mentors.  This is *not* a valueless exchange, and you shouldn't treat it as such.

**Business Planning**

* If you don’t have a business plan, make one. It’s not only a step closer to Entrepreneurship and Chairman’s, but also a philosophy to keep the team running.  It makes money easier to get, and sponsors more likely to stick around because of proven track record of responsibility fiscally.

    * [Writing A Business Plan](#writing-a-business-plan)

    * Business plans shouldn’t just cover the financial details of the team, they should be a guiding document for all team operations and organization.
