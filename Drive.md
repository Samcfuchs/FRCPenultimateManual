## Drive

* Make sure you know the game rules.

* The actions of the human player can greatly determine the outcome of a game.
    * Human players are generally responsible for moving game pieces. A skilled human player can help their alliance control game pieces to maximize scoring and sometimes reduce opponent scoring.

    * Drivers that might fight amongst themselves can have their attention split between the field and their fighting, resulting in mistakes being made.

* Communication between members of drive is *essential*.  Don’t be afraid to talk to one another!

* Teambuilding and culture of a drive team is *very* important.  Try to have some fun when you're not stressing out over the game at hand.

    * For example, 1257's 2016 drive team would play Super Meat Boy to practice reaction timing and Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes to practice their communication skills.  Though interruptive during meetings, effects were found to be clearly noticable.
