## Strategy

**General**

* Knowledge is power. Take every opportunity you can to make yourself more powerful.

* A good robot with great strategy almost always trumps a great robot with good strategy

* Scouting has two primary applications: formulating match strategy and planning for alliance selection.

* Scout at EVERY competition. You never know for sure going into a competition if you'll be an alliance captain. Even if you do not think you have a good enough robot to seed high, you may end up with a nice schedule. Even if you do not pick, the data can be used to formulate smart match strategy.

    * Don’t let a lack of manpower be an excuse. If your team is short-staffed, reach out to other teams at the event to collaborate on scouting

* If you don’t end up scouting for some reason, ask teams if they'd be willing to share their data with you. You would be surprised how many teams would be happy to help a team unexpectedly thrown into a captain spot.

**Pre-Scouting**

* At a non-Week 1 event, you will often compete with teams who have already competed elsewhere during the season. Match video from these prior events may be used to *pre-scout* the teams that will be at your event.

* Pre-scouting can be used to train scouts and test the relevance and usability of scouting sheets or electronic scouting systems.

* Don’t let pre-scouting be an excuse not to scout at the event. Pre-scouting data is *extra* data to supplement the more accurate, up-to-date information collected at the event.

* At District/World Championship events, or even late-season other events, it can save time to prepare a preliminary picklist based on pre-scouting data

    * Do not get too attached to any preliminary picklist.

    * Teams may improve with increased experience playing the game and even develop additional functionality at their later events (e.g. in 2016 when low-goal focused robots successfully implemented shooters mid-season, such as 610)

* Pre-scouting data can be used to identify when a robot had a strong showing at a previous event but encountered issues

    * These issues may be fixable, and you may be able to pick a strong robot other teams at the event may not know about

    * These teams may make especially good risk picks for a low alliance

**Scouting Itself**

* Have one scout dedicated to each robot in the match, recording quantitative data and comments

    * You may also have a "super-scout" or two watching the match as a whole for higher level strategy, defense, driver skill, or anything else of note.

* Look for what good teams do...

    * Quantitatively? In other words, how much do they complete various scoring objectives?

    * Qualitatively? In other words, what is their robot good at and what is their strategy?

* Scouting is not just about how many points a team scored, but how that team performed and what sets them apart from other teams.

* Important qualitative factors to watch for:

    * Drive team skill.

    * CONSISTENCY

    * Recovery from driver mistakes and robot failures.

* When scouting, look for teams’ strengths *and* weaknesses. Both can be used to best them

* Look for teams with the "X-factor", that powerful drive to go above and beyond to win. Some teams demonstrate it with their previous event results. Others demonstrate it in excellent match strategy or driver skill. Look for it, and while it shouldn’t be valued over robot functionality, it can be used to determine the best pick among similar robots.

    * Example: 1257 at Mount Olive 2016, selecting 1676 in order to play defense. Their drivers demonstrated considerable skill during qualifications, and the team has a history of competitive success. There were a number of other robots who *could* have played skilled defense for the alliance, but 1676 went above and beyond and helped them win the event.

* Using electronic scouting is great, but if it seems beyond the team’s reach, resort to just using paper scouting.

    * Just make sure you don’t cut down a forest.

    * Paper is failsafe in a way electronic scouting isn’t.

* Drive team depends on scouts for competition information, and especially for alliance selections.

* Good communication with the drive team is very important, scouting will be useless if the data is not put to good use.

**Making A Picklist**

* There are three ways an alliance partner can contribute to an alliance:

    * Direct offsense: Scoring points (2016 example: scoring goals)

    * Indirect offense: Enabling alliance partners to score points (2016 example: bringing boulders to the courtyard)

    * Defense: Depriving the opposing alliance of points. Most defense falls into one of two categories:

    	* Obstruction defense: physically prevent scoring attempts, by either preventing access to scoring positions or causing shots made to miss, possibly with a wall.

    	* Game piece defense: deny opponents access to game pieces or otherwise make it harder for them to obtain them. This can involved picking up game pieces and placing them in a protected zone from the opponent (the secret passageway in 2016) or by providing them for alliance partners to score, which is called feeding (which doubles to help offense).

    * Always have a contingency plan for defense played against you

* Before starting on a picklist, discuss strategies for playoffs.

    * What would the composition of your ideal alliance look like? Your options include:
    	1. Triple offense (2016 Carver Division, Alliance #2)
    	2. Two offense and one defense (2016 Tesla Division, Alliance #1)
    	3. Two offense and one feeder (2016 Hopper Division, Alliance #1)
    	4. Offense, a feeder, and defense (2016 Waterloo Regional, Alliance #2)
    	5. Offense and two feeders/defense (2012 Newton Division, Alliance #2)
    	* Generally, your choice is between a, b, and c. Deciding between these three options requires examining which will contribute the most to the point margin between yourself and your alliance. Often, a defender can deny their opponents more points than an offense third pick will be able to score. Many times, two offense robots will be more efficient if one robot focuses on feeding game pieces to the other, who scores them, rather than havng both robots acquire and score game pieces themselves.
    	* Option d may make sense if your captain/first pick pair consists of an exceptionally good feeder (fast robot with a fast intake) and an exceptionally high scorer, and the third robot would be able to play better defense than offense.
    	* Option e is generally unwise, if not downright illegal (as it was illegal to have two opposing robots in a courtyard in 2016). However, this does not mean it should never be considered. On rare occasions, one robot scoring game pieces *can* outscore an opposing alliance. In the example listed, the #2 alliance on Newton in 2012 employed this strategy because 1717, the captain, was an incredibly fast and accurate scorer. The alliance had the other two robots (469 and 2471) play on the opposite side of the field, acquiring game pieces and shooting them to other side of the field for 1717 to score.

    * A good guiding question is "how many points would our wekeast robot be able to score, and how does that compare to how many points they can take from our opponent?"

    * What other strategies might your alliance have to face?

    * What kind of robots will make this alliance a reality?

    * What strategy will maximize your chances of winning?

    * Choose a strategy, then *design your alliance around your strategy. *Have a plan to win and choose robots that will help you execute your plan.

* Identify the teams that maximize your chance of winning

    * Don’t simply pick the highest scoring team available, though that is often what maximizes your chance of winning

* If you have ANY chance of finishing in the top fifteen teams, MAKE A PICK LIST (or a few) THE NIGHT BEFORE ALLIANCE SELECTIONS. Have a ranked list of robots you want, or alternatively a separate list for each role you'd want robots for (e.g. shooters, defense, low goal, etc).

    * There should be at least as many teams listed as there will be teams in playoffs (CMP, 32 teams; elsewhere, 24). You should be willing to work with absolutely any of them.

* As additional matches are played after your list is assembled, move teams up and down as needed. Some teams shine on their second day. Others robots break. Keep scouting, and observe upward and downward trends. If robots are having issues, reach out to the teams and find out how fixable they are. A strong robot may be available later than they should be because other scouts were concerned with issues that you know can be resolved. On the other hand, a robot on the rise may be passed over due to their weaker previous showing.

* NEVER leave a robot off your pick list because they "won’t be available by the time you pick". *You never know*

**Alliance Selection**

* Do not just pick the highest ranked available team. Rankings can be deceptive, as teams may have had easy or difficult schedules. Qualification rank says nothing about what a team can actually do in a match

* If you have a good, well-reasoned picklist, you'll be fine for alliance selection. Do not worry about making the perfect pick, just pick the best one from your list.

* The scouting team should talk beforehand and make it clear how much the team representative is allowed to deviate from the prepared list. In the past, I have regretted going strictly by the list rather than by my gut. On the other hand, teammates may be annoyed by going against the mutually agreed-upon ordering.

* When picking alliances, rather than focusing on your picklist, try picking teams based on what other alliances pick, so you can beat them with the greatest advantage.

* When picking, keep in mind where you are picking from and who you will face.

    * Keep in mind how deep the field is and the difference in strength between the top picks, middle picks, and late picks. Where the field "drops off" can make or break alliances.

    * In general, if you are picking from a high captain spot (1,2,3), go for the best consistent robot for your alliance. A robot that fails can cost you quarterfinal or semifinal matches against considerably weaker alliances.

    * In general, if you are picking from a low captain spot (6, 7, 8), go for a somewhat consistent robot with a high ceiling. You will almost certainly be facing a stronger alliance in quarterfinals and semifinals. If you want to make it past those, you will need to upset. A consistent #8 alliance is great, though if they can’t outscore #1, they simply won’t make it past quarterfinals.

    * Before starting your picklist, ask how much risk is acceptable and what your goal is. If you want to win above all else, as is typically desired at regionals and the championship, making riskier picks can make it easier to create a higher-scoring alliance, though also one that is more likely to fail. If you want to make it as far as safely possible, as is typically desired at district events and district championships due to the point system, be more risk-averse, as risky picks can cost precious district points if they fail early on.

* A whiteboard can be a valuable tool for communicating pick suggestions to the team representative.

* *A note on declines:*

    * As you most likely know, when a team declines an invitation during alliance selection, that team cannot accept any other team’s invitation.

    * On a superficial level, being declined may seem embarrassing. However, in order to maximize your chances of success, you must embrace that *declines are part of the game of alliance selection*.

    * Declines are primarily motivated by one reason: a team is confident they will be able to select another robot that they deem a better fit for their alliance.

        * It may be that there is a robot that better fits the role they want

        * It may be that there are simply better robots available

    * A valuable tactic that should be in every alliance captain’s toolbox is what is referred to as "scorching the earth". This can be employed when an alliance captain may be considered weaker than the alliance captains ranked below it. This alliance captain can invite other alliance captains to join their alliance *with the knowledge that they will likely decline to form their own alliance*. This is repeated as desired, and if no captains accept, a team from outside the top eight teams is invited, who has to accept in order to play in playoffs. This renders these captains unable to be picked, splitting up strong teams and weakening the other alliances.

    * The most well-known example of the scorched-earth tactic is the 2013 Curie Division alliance selection. The #1 seed, 1678, invited the #6 (1717), #4 (2056), #5 (1310), and #7 (359) seeds who *all decline.* 1678 then invited the #16 seed (148), who was forced to accept. As a result, there was *no* inter-picking within the top eight teams. None of the teams who declined 1678 advanced past quarterfinals except 2056, who 1678 defeated in semifinals. While 1678 was able to win the division and advance to Einstein, they did not win in an especially dominant fashion, going to three matches in both semifinals and finals.

    * There is one important catch to scorching the earth: *any team you invite may accept your invitation*. Be ready to work with any team you invite! Do not shoot yourself in the foot by inviting a team you do not want to work with purely to separate them from other teams.
