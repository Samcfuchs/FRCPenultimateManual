# Competition Notes

No matter the type, scale, or location of event, follow the rules of it to the letter.  Reading the Administration Manual may help, but is rather heavy…  Generally, don’t do anything that could be in any way be construed as cheating / not being GP.  No Wi-Fi access points / hotspots, no being rude to other teams, team mates, drivers, etc.  Respect others pit areas, and above all else, remember that everyone else there loves the competition just as much as you.  Don’t treat them with any less respect than they deserve for it.

* Regular District Events

    * Bring snacks, prices vary per venue.

        * Some venues prohibit outside food and drinks. Some do search bags to enforce this rule.

    * A schedule helps a LOT.

    * Follow said schedule.

    * The drive team knows when you’re not cheering, the arena mood changes.  Help them help everyone!  **CHEER!**

    * Spirit is important, not for the trophy, but for your morale.  Fake it ‘till you make it!

        * Spirit makes competition more fun.

    * If there are audience selections are important, especially if your team is playing

    * If you don’t know, **ASK! **People like sharing what they know, especially in FIRST.

    * Every team is a potential ally, even if they’re against you in the next match.

    *If you're having problems, don't be afraid to ask for help.  Other teams *will* help you out of the kindness of their heart, it's just part of the culture!

    * Get used to songs on loop, it happens more than anyone is comfortable with...

    * Get to know the event flow before hand, if at all possible.  Ask another teammate who's been there before.

        * Know who’s who.

    * If a "bad" call is made, don’t try and force a ref to see footage you took with your phone or anything.  They do **NOT** look at footage, and cannot.  Don’t force them into an awkward situation.

    * It is highly encouraged to talk to people from other teams.

    * Remember, everyone is stressed at these events.

    * If, at any point, you feel lightheaded, take a walk somewhere where there aren’t many people.

* District Championship (DCMP)

    * See Regular Events

    * High-Stress ⇒ Don’t forget to eat!

    * Do not expect to perform the same at District Events as well, teams have their own strengths and weaknesses.

    * Be aware: Judges may judge differently here, a bit more strict on rules compared to other events.

    * Get to know the event flow before hand, if at all possible.  Ask another teammate who's been there before.

* World Championship (FRC CMP)

    * As high stress as it gets, be prepared.  High-strung people **everywhere.**

    * Pack EVERYTHING you *need*, not everything you *want*.

    * Bring your own amenities (shampoo, toothpaste).

    * Eating on time will be difficult, but you NEED to.

    * Expect not to sleep as well as you would in your own bed.

    * The entire event is totally different from any event you’ve ever been to.

        * Different refereeing: The rules may be interpreted differently field to field.

        * Layout is a LONG walk (St. Louis) (~1 mile stands ⇒ pit, Archimedes 2016)

        * Food is EXPENSIVE.  (St. Louis ⇒ Go to Culinaria up the street. ~4 blocks)

        * Merch can be had AT the event, bring spare change.

            * A event shirt can be anywhere between 20 and 100 dollars.

        * Event Handbooks are INCREDIBLY useful for not just people attending to see robots, but for teams.

            * They have pit assignments in the guidebook.

            * They’re free, and usually near entrances.  Get two copies, for when you lose one / give it to a mentor to have / look at.

    * The pit pathway is long.  Multiple carts are useful (eg robot & spares)

    * Mentors:

        * Get the hotel rooms as **FAR IN ADVANCE AS POSSIBLE**.

            * They only go up in price.

            * Same for plane tickets.

        * Do your own bag check (if by plane) the day before, so that you can get through lines quickly at the airport.

        * Logistics will eat up most of your time between your DCMP and your CMP.  Plan accordingly.

        * If you are doing well in district play, start looking at logistics long before DCMP.

* Offseasons

    * Very different culture, much calmer & more relaxed.

    * Lower overall costs (500 versus 5k)

    * Often used to train backup / upcoming drive teams.

    * Sometimes have silly rules (human robot matches, robot vs humans, etc.)

    * A good way to get someone into FRC for the next season.

    * Occasionally has pre-rookie teams (registering for the next season next year)

    * Occasionally just as stressful as a regular event (see "Indiana Robotics Invitational")
