# Rules for Everyone

* Contribute to the team as much as you can, even though it might be something small.

* Keep a cool head at all times.

* It doesn’t hurt to help another team, **ever**. They love FRC just as much as you do!
* Sit down once a match begins / after your team is selected for an alliance.

* NEVER talk badly about another team.  They know their own mistakes as well as your own team knows theirs.

* Read the RULES!  You never know when you’ll be doing someone else’s job.

* Mentors and captains are there to help **everyone** on your team, not just you. They’re also really nice.

* Talk to other subteams, your visions may not align, or may be shared! Communication amongst team members is equally as important as comms between the DS & the ROBOT. *Collaborate!*

* Always be positive. Please don’t talk negatively about yourself, a specific group of people, or the team in general. Attitude is everything.

* Don’t be afraid to ask questions.

* MAKE FRIENDS. People are so nice.

* There is *always* something to do, you just have to ask.

* While many of us would love to dedicate all of our energy to the team (and some of us do), unfortunately, we still have other, very important priorities. DO NOT let robotics become your #1 priority. That GPA is more important.

    * Don’t lose sight of your future goals and dreams. That being said, putting your entire heart and soul into the team can be a good thing. Just keep consequences in mind.

* Don’t take disagreements on robot or team decisions personally. Everyone wants the best for the team, even though there may be disagreements as to what that is.

* * *


*Train the way you fight. Because you will fight the way you have been trained - Sun Tzu*

# Good Resources

## Karthik’s Lectures

Karthik is a successful lecturer, former mentor of team 1114 Simbotics, and the head of the VEX Game Design Committee.  He’s lectured year after year at CMP in St. Louis talking about the various successful components of an FRC team.  He covers everything from game analysis to scouting and strategy (including alliance selection).  Watching at least one of the videos below is a good idea in general.

* The Subtle Secret To Success TEDxUTSC

* Effective FIRST Strategies 2013

    * [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk_X-maRf8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk_X-maRf8)

	Watching at least the first two are highly recommended, and are applicable not only in FRC / FIRST, but in anything you do.  Overall, the general message is simple.  When you are passionate about something, it becomes easy to not only meet expectation, but to exceed it.  However, please note that a general summary to Karthik’s lectures does in NO way do them justice,and viewing them yourself would be a great benefit to you.

## Gracious Professionalism / Coopertition

[http://www.firstinspires.org/about/vision-and-mission](http://www.firstinspires.org/about/vision-and-mission)

*"Gracious Professionalism is part of the ethos of FIRST. It's a way of doing things that encourages high-quality work, emphasizes the value of others, and respects individuals and the community.*

*With Gracious Professionalism, fierce competition and mutual gain are not separate notions. Gracious professionals learn and compete like crazy, but treat one another with respect and kindness in the process. They avoid treating anyone like losers. No chest thumping tough talk, but no sticky-sweet platitudes either. Knowledge, competition, and empathy are comfortably blended.*

*In the long run, Gracious Professionalism is part of pursuing a meaningful life. One can add to society and enjoy the satisfaction of knowing one has acted with integrity and sensitivity."*

### Coopertition®

*Coopertition®* produces innovation. At FIRST, Coopertition is displaying unqualified kindness and respect in the face of fierce competition. Coopertition is founded on the concept and a philosophy that teams can and should help and cooperate with each other even as they compete.*

*Coopertition involves learning from teammates. It is teaching teammates. It is learning from Mentors. And it is managing and being managed. Coopertition means competing always, but assisting and enabling others when you can."*

Gracious Professionalism and Coopertition may seem like buzzwords, but they are and become to each participant the spirit of competition.  To read the words on a piece of paper, or in the many manuals of competition is one thing, but to experience them is an entirely different thing.  People acting so selflessly, to forward not their personal agendas, but the values that they aim to extend to everyone they know, is inspiring.  One such example is that of a soccer goalie, unable to tie his shoes.  A player from the opposing team walked over and tied them for him, enabling the opponents to get a free kick.  The opposing team, however, threw the free kick, allowing the game to continue on as normal.    Without Gracious Professionalism and Coopertition, there would be no FIRST in the form we know it today.

## Jack Kamen & Imagery Award

Jack Kamen was the father of Dean, founder of FIRST.  He was a comic book illustrator who supported Dean in everything he did, perhaps helping him do things he never would have otherwise.  He was to Dean, what Dean Kamen is to the FIRST Family of teams and districts, inspirational and right in everything he did.  The logo of FIRST and all FIRST events was designed by him, and in 2011, the FRC GDC honored him with a game, Logo-Motion.  In addition, his long-lasting mark is the Imagery Award, presented at each event, in his honor.

*
"In honor of Jack Kamen, Dean’s father, for his dedication to art and illustration and his devotion to FIRST. This award celebrates attractiveness in engineering and outstanding visual aesthetic integration of machine and team appearance.“*

# Indispensable Tools & Techniques

Certain tools throughout a build season are both essential and easy to lose.  A quick list use useful ones:

* Screwdriver Set (two of ‘em, for when you have two subteams)

* Wrench Set (metric & US, though you really should only use one when building a robot.  STANDARDIZE!)

    * Mark your most commonly use wrench off with tape to speed up pit repairs.

    * For example, the 7/16ths wrenches on 1257 were covered with red tape to be found easily.  We have / had about half a dozen of them.

* Wire Cutters

    * A good sharp pair is essential for trimming zip-ties, wires, and a whole load of other things.  If you have a dull pair of cutters, it can stop the whole rhythm of the robot checklist in the pit, which is not a nice thing to have when you may or may not have

    * Many posts on Chief Delphi recommend this pair:

## Chairman's Award

* The Chairman's award is awarded to a team that best exemplifies the goals and mission of *FIRST*.  It shouldn't be something you go for because it sounds prestegious, but rather something a team should work for if a majority of their actions both on and off season reflect the *FIRST* mission.

## Keys To a Successful Drive Team (254 and Travis Covington)

[https://frcdesigns.com/2016/01/08/keys-to-a-successful-drive-team-an-interview-with-travis-covington/](https://frcdesigns.com/2016/01/08/keys-to-a-successful-drive-team-an-interview-with-travis-covington/)

Excerpts:

* *"What do tryouts for drivers look like on 254?"*

TC: We try to bring up new drivers early and retain them for as long as possible.  We feel that the driver can be one of the most important roles on the team, and requires some skills that need to be taught and that can be honed with time/practice.  The more experience once trained initially, the better.  Many of our best drivers started as Freshman/Sophomores and drove for 3+ years."

* *"What factors into your decisions on drivers?"*

TC: Many things, least of which is actual skill driving the robot.  We have a large list of criteria which we send to the whole team prior to tryouts or selection.  It is a prioritized list, from most important qualities to least important.  At the top of the list is Maturity.  The "Driver Qualities" list is as follows: *

* Mature

* Communicative

* Respectful [and] Cooperative

* Humble & Accommodating

* Dedicated & Hardworking

* Experienced

* Skilled & Assertive

* Knowledgeable in Mechanical, Electrical & Controls aspects of the robot

* As you can see, knowledge of the robot is not a huge concern.  Many of the things above cannot be taught and are harder to find.  We also have attendance and GPA requirements of our drivers.  These bullet points are explained on our selection criteria document but are summarized here for simplicity."

## 6054: What We Learned

* [https://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?p=1591100#post1591100](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?p=1591100#post1591100)

1. Lessons Learned:

2. Ordering parts is hard. Getting a system in place at the school to decide you need a part, and get it sooner than 3 weeks requires some outside the box methods of procurement for a school district.

3. The Kitbot is really good. It was simple yet flexible enough to allow us to modify it. The time we saved was crucial to writing code, and practicing driving.

4. Having FRC teams to rely on is awesome. We were lucky enough to be part of the NEOFRA [Northeast Ohio FIRST Robotics Alliance], and going to kick off with those teams, and seeing their robots from previous years was awesome. New teams should definitely find nearby teams to work with.

5. The control system setup walkthrough needs special attention to detail. A slight omission on step 4 of 30 will have you banging your head against the wall for days trying to get it sorted out.

6. Metal shavings are very bad for electrical components.

7. The stress on the drive team is hard to simulate outside competition.

8. As a new team try to pick a few things to well in the game. If you have time to add in new functionality after mastering that…. Nah, you won’t have time.

9. Getting sponsors is difficult. The average manager at a car dealership isn’t as excited about robotics as a high school student. You need to have a few kids that are able to sell your team, your vision, and FIRST in general.

10. It’s really important to keep track of dates like when FIRSTchoice opens, and when registration is due, and all the things that are on deadlines.

11. Retired mentors make great mentors. They have more free time, and a lifetime of experience.

## ScreenStepsLive WPILib

ScreenStepsLive is an invaluable tool for programmers who need to work on the robot code.  They have examples in C++, Java and MatLab, though the concepts of PID tuning (among other things) are uniform to FRC regardless of the programming language due to the inherent nature of the RoboRIO.

* [http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/](http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/)

## QDriverStation

QDriverStation is an open-source implementation of the driver station that runs on Linux, Windows and macOS.  Supports virtual joysticks, and quite a few driver-station protocols.  Not allowed for official competition, but okay for demos & offseasons if they allow it.

## Advice for Rookie You?

This was a thread started by one of 1257’s rookies at the end of the 2016 season with the intention of finding out what other people would tell their rookie selves.  A way to go back and see what they’d have done differently, and any advice they think that they as individuals would have needed.  Applies to both mentors and students.

* [https://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=148836](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=148836)

*"Although I am still technically a rookie, I'll answer anyways. My answers are more geared towards advice for new rookies, but I hope not just rookies can learn from some of the things I experienced. Here goes it!"*

* **Hard work and long nights pay off.**

After weeks and weeks of long nights, delays, and problems, you might start asking why you are even still involved. Just keep doing the best work you can. When you see the robot that you poured 6+ weeks of your life in to at your event, on the field, it is one of the best feelings in FIRST!

* **Try your best, no matter what.**

While times may be tough, especially your rookie season, stay strong and try your best. The knowledge and experience you will gain from FRC is worth it.

* **"Powerhouse" teams are some of the kindest and gracious people you will ever meet.**

While they may seem scary with their large looming pits and many students and mentors, don't be frightened! Much of what I know is gathered from conversations with members of 254, 1678, 971, etc. Don't be afraid to reach out to these people and talk to them at competitions. I guarantee that you will learn something new.

* **Don't be afraid to meet new people and build relationships.**

Similar to the above, always meet new people and talk with them. You will gain so much knowledge and wisdom from other people. Just from talking with people, I now can contact some of the most esteemed minds in FRC when I need help or have questions.

* **Take advantage of any opportunities you are given.**

Always take advantage of opportunities that are presented to you. For example, I got to experience so much and learn so many things my rookie year from taking advantage of opportunities like visiting other team's shops, going to Champs, and just talking to people at events.

* **Clean up as you go, don't leave a huge mess at the end of a build session.**

Many times this build season we would leave tools out after finishing a task and put off cleaning up scraps, putting away tools, etc. This then left a major cleanup at the end of a session, which no one wants to do at 9:30pm after a long school day. Something we learned was to have an ongoing clean-up. This allowed us to leave faster after sessions and everyone was in a better mood!

* **Get a printer and make mechanical drawings.**

As one of my colleagues said in another thread, without a printer our robot probably wouldn't have gotten finished. Using mechanical drawings allowed us to speed up fabrication of parts ten fold.

* **Help other teams!**

There is nothing better than helping to improve another team's bot! We sent a team of students and a technical mentor to 253 at SVR to work on their robot so they could play their last qualification match. The feeling when our fix to keep their battery in worked was like nothing else.

## Writing a Business Plan

Various teams share their business plans during the offseason, and for previous years.  If you don’t have a proper plan yet, making one is a good idea.  If only to serve as a code of conduct for working with sponsors, adding it is essential.  Professional sponsors with professional recipients, especially those with a long term plan, can cultivate larger sponsorships during mergers and absolution.

## Roles of Team Captain

* [https://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?p=977217#post977217](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?p=977217#post977217)

*"In my time in FRC (this is my 8th year of involvement), the best team captains on any team should have one assigned job. **Make sure everyone else on the team is busy at all times.**  Other than that they should delegate everything they do. But here are some other thoughts on qualifications great team captains should have:*

* *ability to delegate*

* *ability to come up with ideas and jobs for others to do (anybody ever look about how many people sit around and become disengaged?)*

* *ability to make quick decisions*

* *ability to motivate*

* *a work ethic to model after*

* *an idea of what FIRST is all about (heres a hint, its not all about the robot)*

* *no interest in actually building the robot (there are so many other things for a captain to do, they'll have no time for the actual robot, unless your team is smaller than 8 people (in which case you might want to try Vex).*

* *the idea of what a deadline is*

* *social skills to talk to judges/other teams/VIPs*

* *ability to say screw it, nothing is ever perfect and relax at the end of the day*

* *Being on the drive team, being the person who gets to pick the final design, all of those *perks* are not in the best interest of the team. The best leaders let those who are the best at what they do, do what they do (and then give them credit for it).*

* *Also on a note, being a senior/oldest member on the team/most experienced should have nothing to do with being team captain. Rookie teams have team captains any 9 times out of 10, nobody has any experience. Actually, some of the best team captains I've seen have been from rookie teams.*

## Chief Delphi Quotes

Though they may not seem it, Chief Delphi Spotlights can be an interesting way to view FIRST history, as people chatter throughout the more than decade of the site’s history.  Examples of profoundness include:

*"Some of us should be so lucky to have something go wrong on Einstein." - Kevin Sevcik*

*"Yes ONE blue banner would be nice one of these days, but I've never lost focus of why we as mentors do what we do. It's about preparing the students for "defense" in life, and laugh when your robot gets scored into a goal." - Chris_Elston*

*"Welcome to FIRST, the place where you can be competitive in a team. Here people can learn more in one year of FIRST than in four years of high school." - dude__hi*

Just note that it can also be host to the likes of these:

*"Your cat-bell skills are most impressive." - Andy Baker *

*"What is this... extreme air-keyboarding?...For those about to type, we salute you. “- Andy Baker*

*"Never underestimate people's ability to underestimate." - Ginger Power*
