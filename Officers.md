## Officers & Leadership

* **Lead by example**, not by order. You are not an exception to doing work.

* **Set clear goals and make sure you have a plan outlined.**

* **Keep the goals simple, brief and achievable.**

* **Set a timeline and/or deadlines. Adhere to these.**

* **Delegate effectively, so you can get more done - other team members get experience and you can stay sane.**

* Remember:

    * People see you as role models, whether you want them to or not.

    * It’s still just a **game.**

* Notes are important.  All subteams taking notes makes recalling binned ideas that may help the team later is important.

* Account for mistakes, plan for them, but don’t hold it over someone’s head.  It’ll never help the team as a whole, and ruins the mood.

* The best plans are the ones that work and get the job done efficiently.

* Know who’s who.

* A team that fights within itself can never defend against others.  Solve internal struggles and the external ones slacken.

* No one needs to be able to do everything, though the officer team needs to be able to make sure everything gets done.

* Make good friends out of your teammates, and the dynamic that produces an amazing team is soon to follow.
