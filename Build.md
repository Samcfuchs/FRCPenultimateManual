## Build

* Strategy should happen before design and design should happen before fabrication.

    * Not that strategy can never be re-evaluated during design or design can be revised during fabrication

* Focus on having a working robot that achieves its strategy goals, not about its design.

* Determine whether you want a robot that specializes in one aspect of the game, or one that can be cheesecaked and can support the alliance.

* Bringing multiple battery chargers is a GOOD idea.

* Developing a new feature/mechanism for the robot during competition is almost impossible when focusing on match preparation.
