## Programming

* Don’t over complicate your code.

* Clean code is good, functional code is better.

* Changing the code during competitions is do-able, but risky, so try to avoid it.

    * Try to test it a practice field if possible

* Use WPILib & Screensteps if starting off, and ask your fellow programmers for help!

* Pick a programming language that works for your team.  You don’t have to work on the language other teams are using, but use what your team knows, and can support.
