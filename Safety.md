## Safety

* Safety is one of the most important parts of an FRC team.

    * Make sure people recognize that and not take it as a joke.

    * It is* just* as important as build or electronics or other subteams.

* Improvement is everything

    * Make gradual changes in building a well rounded safety program.

* Start by making a PPT on basic rules for the school environment and specific machinery

    * Collaborate with captains from other subteams and pit crew members to show new members the works of tools and precautions needed to know

    * Make safety quizzes that require 100% passing to demonstrate understanding

    * Make safety contracts and rules and make sure both the parent and the student signs it (if the student/parent does not sign it, the student should not be able to participate--- check with mentor to approve of this notion)

    * Keep records (e.g. injury records), but do not show PHI to FRC judges; it is private info.

* Over time, start showing judges your comparison from a few years after creating a concrete program to the hectic whirlwind of what the club was like before.

    * Progress is important.

* As a safety captain, familiarize yourself with some of the tools used. That way, you can point out hazards to members and help others.

* *It may not seem like it, but you hold a lot of responsibility for the members and mentors of the team.*

    * Their safety may/may not fall back on you in some circumstances.

* DO NOT try intimidating students/or using scare tactics; it won’t work

    * Teaching and making sure they understand what they’re doing and what they put themselves at risks for is key.

* Get to know every person, even if their subteam is not in build or electronics.

    * Some people hide their injuries without telling the captain (big mistake!), you need to make sure you are able to catch when they do it and tell them not do it again.

* Make your own team Safety Rulebook, specific with your school’s rules and regulations (if you are part of a school)

* Teach members responsibility by having the team purchase new safety glasses for each new member (you will have to discuss this with your mentor/advisor) and telling them that the team will not buy new pairs if they are damaged or lost

    * If the safety glasses do not have a side and upper (distance covering space from eyes to glasses) guard, they are NOT safety glasses.

    * Prescription glasses used in daily life are NOT safety glasses

* Make sure to make clear distinctions between safety at school vs. at the arena

    * 2 different areas, more things to watch out for and rules to follow

* When competition comes around, make something that sums up your safety program and hand it out to other safety captains while getting to know their team program

    * They could have something in their program you don’t have that could be a good idea to implement

    * Also helps to give it to safety judges when they come around

* Have 2 Safety Co-Captains, that way both people can rotate being in the pits during competition and one person won’t be dead tired.

    * One in the Pits, one in the stands to make sure everything is good in both settings.

* Have 2 first aid kits, one in the pits and one in the stands with a co-capt

* Help out with the robots pre-match checklist.

    * Make one if you don’t have one.

* Make a checklist of things to bring to competition.

* Make a binder for all types of documentation.

    * Have the FRC Safety Manual

    * Sort out all types of documentation by year or by type of document

        * E.g. - Injury reports or Safety contracts

* Bring a trash can to competition

    * Metal, hopefully.

    * Multifaceted / Many Uses.

* Before every competition, discuss an emergency plan and place to meet in case of emergency

* Be CPR/First Aid certified

    * Not only is it an incredibly useful thing to be, but it also looks good to Judges and other officials.

* Have machinery checks of the machines used the most (ask build captain about this) to check for damages and possibly brokenness

    * Do this especially during build season (it would be horrible to use a broken machine unexpectedly and get hurt)
