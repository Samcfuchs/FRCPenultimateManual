## Electronics

* Checklists are helpful.

    * **Never** skip a checklist if you use them, though you may add to one at an event.

* When a robot breaks down, it is usually an electronics problem, so make sure your robot works before going onto the field.

    * For example: RSL Brownout

* Make sure you turn your robot is turned on. *This is important*.

* ALWAYS connect to the field at least once before qualification matches start.
