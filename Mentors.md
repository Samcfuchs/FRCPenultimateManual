## Mentors

* There’s no such thing as a bad idea, consider everything.

* Planning and note-taking can save you, write stuff down!

* Not all other mentors are GP, you must be in the face of all adversary.

* Maintaining a flow of information from year to year is useful.

    * Writing down everything the team did well, and how they did it at the end of each season might help.

* You are a student as well.  Never stop learning.

* Every opportunity is a learning one.  Never pass it up.

* Volunteering gives you a chance to not only understanding both sides of the Competition Coin, but also to respect those who do it, and appreciate what they do in the "muscles I didn’t know exist hurt" sort of way.

    * Shoutout to the Field Reset Crew (the recursive FRC!)

* Your actions reflect those of your students in both directions.  You reflect them and they reflect you.  Start off on the right foot and follow any philosophy you preach.  "Do as I say, not as I do" seldom works in this competitive environment.

* Try to break up your responsibilties, that way if the team gains another mentor with specialization, it helps you more.

* All subteams are not created equal in the eyes of your students.  Be aware of this and *never* treat working on a specific subteam (especially scouting) like a chore.  If anything, you can increase burnout and lose students quickly.
